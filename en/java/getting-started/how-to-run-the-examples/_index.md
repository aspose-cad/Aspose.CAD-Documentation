## **Adding Aspose.CAD Library into Maven Local Repository**

When you import **Aspose.CAD Examples** project into IDE, Maven automatically downloads aspose.cad JAR file from [Aspose Maven Repository](https://releases.aspose.com/java/repo/). In case you do not have access to internet, you can manually add JAR in your local repository.

### **mvn install**

Download the [aspose.cad](https://releases.aspose.com/java/repo/com/aspose/aspose-cad/), extract it and copy the aspose.cad-version.jar to somewhere else, for example, c drive. Issue following command:

{{< highlight java >}}

 mvn install:install-file

    -Dfile=c:\aspose.cad-version.jar

    -DgroupId=com.aspose

    -DartifactId=aspose-cad

    -Dversion={version}

    -Dpackaging=jar

{{< /highlight >}}

Now, the **aspose.cad** jar is copied to your Maven local repository.

### **pom.xml**

After installed, just declares the **aspose.cad** coordinate in pom.xml.

{{< highlight java >}}

 <dependency>

    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>

    <artifactId>aspose-cad</artifactId>

    <version>17.11</version>

    <classifier>jdk16</classifier>

Â </dependency>

{{< /highlight >}}
