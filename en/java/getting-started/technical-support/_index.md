If you have an issue with Aspose.CAD, follow these simple steps to make sure it is resolved in the most efficient way:

- Make sure you use the latest Aspose.CAD version before reporting the issue, see [Aspose.CAD for Java Downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/java/repo/com/aspose/aspose-cad/) to find out about the latest version.
- Have a look through the forums, this documentation and API Reference before reporting the issue; maybe your question was already answered.
- When reporting an issue, please include the original document and possibly a fragment of your code that causes the problem. If you need to attach multiple files, zip them into one. It is safe to attach your documents in Aspose.Forums since only you and Aspose developers will have access to the attached files.
- Please try to report one issue per thread. If you have another issue, report it in a separate thread.
