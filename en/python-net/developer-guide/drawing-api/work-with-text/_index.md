## **Work with text**

Almost all drawings contain text objects and these examples show how to perform operations with them. 
There are different types of entities for DWG/DXF that can store text, they are **CadText**,**CadMText**,CadAttDef, CadAttrib. Two last types are typically related 
to **CadInsertObject** and stored inside it or in the corresponding block.

Here are some examples describing operations with text.
