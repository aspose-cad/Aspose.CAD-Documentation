To run Aspose.CAD for JasperReports demos, perform the following steps:

1. Download JasperReports (e.g <https://sourceforge.net/projects/jasperreports/files/archive/>). Make sure to download the entire archived project with the source code and demos, not just a single JAR.
1. Unpack the archived project to some location on your hard disk, for example C:\.
1. Copy all demo folders from the \samples folder of **aspose-cad-xx.x.zip** to **\<InstallDir>\demo\samples**, where "\<InstallDir>" is the location you have unpacked JasperReports to. This step is required because demo build scripts rely on the JasperReportsâ€™ folder structure, otherwise you will need to modify build scripts.
1. Copy **aspose-cad-jasperreports-xx.x.jar** from the \lib folder of **aspose-cad-jasperreports-xx.x.zip** to **\<InstallDir>\lib**.
1. Prepare Ant Build Tool and Ivy Dependency Manager, see **\<InstallDir>\readme.txt**.
1. Modify the **build.xml** at **\<InstallDir>\demo\samples**, add the aspose-cad-jasperreports-xx.x.jar into the classpath:
   **\<path id="project-classpath"> ... \<pathelement location="../../lib/aspose-cad-jasperreports-xx.xx.jar"/> </path>**.
1. Change the current directory to **\<InstallDir>\demo\hsqldb** and run the following command line:
   **ant runServer**
1. Change the current directory to one of the Aspose.CAD for JasperReports demos, for example **\<InstallDir>\demo\samples\charts.ai** and run the following commands in the command line:
   **ant test** - to produce report files.
1. Open one of the resulting documents to view, for example **\<InstallDir>\demo\samples\charts.ai\build\reports\AreaChartReport.jpg**.
