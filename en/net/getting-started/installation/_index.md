In the package manager console, you can also use the command “**Update-Package Aspose.CAD**” and press enter to check for any updates to the Aspose.CAD package and install them if present. You can also add the "-prerelease" suffix to update latest release.

## **Considerations When Running on a Shared Server Environment**

All Aspose .NET components are recommended to run with Full Trust permission set. This is because Aspose .NET component sometimes need to access registry settings and files located in places other than the virtual directory e.g. for reading fonts etc. Furthermore, Aspose.NET components are based on core .NET system classes, some of which also require Full Trust permission to run in some cases.

Internet Service Providers hosting multiple applications from different companies mostly enforce Medium Trust security level. In the case of .NET 2.0, such a security level may set the following constraints which could affect the ability of Aspose.CAD to perform properly.

- **RegistryPermission** is not available. This means you cannot access the registry, which is required to enumerate installed fonts when rendering documents.
- **FileIOPermission** is restricted. This means you can only access files in your application’s virtual directory hierarchy. This potentially means fonts cannot be read during export.

For these reasons specified above, it is recommended that Aspose.CAD is run on Full Trust permissions. You may find that some features of library will work when performing different tasks in Medium trust while some won't (rendering for example) which may due to calls to GDI+ image processing.
