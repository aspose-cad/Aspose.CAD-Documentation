## **Setting ATTRIB and MTEXT objects**
Aspose.CAD for .NET API allows you to set Attribute in a DXF AutCAD file. Aspose.CAD API exposes the [**CadText**](https://reference.aspose.com/cad/net/aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.cadobjects/cadtext) class that represents text entities in the DXF AutoCAD file. The [**CadMText**](https://reference.aspose.com/cad/net/aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.cadobjects/cadmtext) class is included in the Aspose.CAD API because some other entities may also contain text. You can create several paragraphs of text as a single multi-line text (**mtext**) object. Following is the code demonstration of setting Attribute and MTEXT objects. The code snippet is self-explanatory.
