## **Add Watermark in a DWG**

Sometimes you want to add some watermarks to drawings to indicate what purpose of the drawings or who created them. Aspose.CAD for .NET allows you to add a watermark in a DWG file. This can be done through creating a Text or MText entity with a specific text height, rotation, style, adjustments and such should be adjusted as well to give a good look. For this, the API provides [**CadMText**](https://reference.aspose.com/cad/net/aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.cadobjects/cadmtext) and [**CadText**](https://reference.aspose.com/cad/net/aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.cadobjects/cadtext) classes.

## Sample Code

The code below shows how to achieve the same goal using Aspose.CAD for .NET
