## **How to generate DXF**

**Issue:** How to generate DXF.

**Tips:** For this you can use different objects to render shapes such as LINE, CIRCLE, ARC, TEXT, POINT, SOLID, 3DFACE and POLYLINE, after that don't forget to add shapes as entities.

**Note:** We have the functionality to create a DXf file from scratch.
By default we use AC109 file format, but with the option to specify another file version.

**Example:**
