## **Search Text In DWG AutoCAD File**
Aspose.CAD for .NET API allows you to search text in a DWG AutoCAD file. Aspose.CAD API exposes the [**CadText**](https://reference.aspose.com/cad/net/aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.cadobjects/cadtext) class that represents text entities in the DWG AutoCAD file. The [**CadMText**](https://reference.aspose.com/cad/net/aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.cadobjects/cadmtext) class is also included in the Aspose.CAD API because some other entities may also contain text. Following is the code demonstration of the text search in the DWG AutoCAD file. The code snippet is self-explanatory.
