## **How to convert DWG to DWF**

Aspose.CAD provides the feature to load the AutoCAD [DWG](https://docs.fileformat.com/cad/dwg/) file and export it to the [DWF](https://docs.fileformat.com/cad/dwf/) format. DWG to DWF conversion approach works as follows:

1. Load DWG drawing file using the [**Image.Load**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cad/net/aspose.cad/image/methods/load/index) factory method.
1. Export the DWG drawing to DXF using the [**Image.Save**](https://apireference.aspose.com/cad/net/aspose.cad/image/methods/save/index) method.
