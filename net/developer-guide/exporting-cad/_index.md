## **Export 3D AutoCAD Images to PDF**

Aspose.CAD allows you to export 3D AutoCAD images to PDF. Please use the [**Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.CadRasterizationOptions**](https://reference.aspose.com/cad/net/aspose.cad.imageoptions/cadrasterizationoptions) to specify that you want to export 3D entities.

The following sample code loads an AutoCAD 3D file and exports it to [PDF](https://docs.fileformat.com/pdf/). Once the file is converted to PDF, you can open it using your favorite PDF viewer.

## **Exporting CAD Layouts to PDF**

Aspose.CAD for .NET allows you to export CAD layouts to PDF. The [**Save**](https://reference.aspose.com/cad/net/aspose.cad/image/methods/save/index) method of the [**CadImage**](https://reference.aspose.com/cad/net/aspose.cad.fileformats.cad/cadimage) class can be used to export layout(s) to [PDF](https://docs.fileformat.com/pdf/) format.

The following sample code loads a CAD file and exports its "Model" layout to PDF. Once the file is converted to PDF, you can open it using your favorite PDF viewer.
