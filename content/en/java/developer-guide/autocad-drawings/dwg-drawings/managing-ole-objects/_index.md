Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) is a Microsoft Windows feature that allows you to copy or move information from one application to another while you retain the ability to edit the information in the original application.Â  Basically, OLE combines data from different applications into one document. To use OLE, you need both source and destination applications that support OLE.
