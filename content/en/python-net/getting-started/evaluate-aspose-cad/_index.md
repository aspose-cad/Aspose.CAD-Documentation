You can easily download Aspose.CAD for Python for evaluation from the [download page](https://downloads.aspose.com/cad/python-net). The evaluation download is same as the purchased download. The evaluation version simply becomes licensed after [applying a license](/cad/python-net/licensing/).

Evaluation version of Aspose.CAD for Python (without a license specified) provides product functionality to some extent not complete though. One limitation is that it always injects the evaluation watermark on output files.

If you want to test Aspose.CAD for Python without evaluation version limitations, you may [request a 30-day temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license).
