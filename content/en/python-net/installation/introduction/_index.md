## PyPI(Python Package Index)

A substantial number of software packages produced by the Python community are stored at PyPI. It serves as a central hub for developers to share, publish, and distribute their Python libraries, frameworks, and applications. It is straightforward for other developers to access and install these packages thanks to the "pip" program. PyPI makes it more easier for programmers to share their work with the greater Python community, which substantially facilitates collaboration.

## pip(Package Installer for Python)

pip(Package Installer for Python) is a command-line package management tool that comes bundled with Python since version 2.7.9 and 3.4. It is used to install, upgrade, and manage Python packages from PyPI or other package indexes. With pip, developers can effortlessly download and install libraries and dependencies required for their Python projects. It automatically handles versioning, ensuring the correct versions of packages are installed, and can even uninstall packages if needed. Pip has become the standard package manager for Python, making it incredibly convenient for developers to manage their projects' dependencies efficiently.
