### **DWG File Format**

A [DWG](https://docs.fileformat.com/cad/dwg/) is a binary file that contains vector image data and metadata. The vector image data provides instructions to the CAD application about how to display the DWG; the metadata may contain a variety of information about the file including location-specific data and also client data. Open Specifications for DWG file format can be found [in this PDF](http://opendesign.com/files/guestdownloads/OpenDesign_Specification_for_.dwg_files.pdf)

### **Convert DWG Files to PDF**

The following simple steps are required to convert [DWG](https://docs.fileformat.com/cad/dwg/) to [PDF](https://docs.fileformat.com/pdf/).

1. Load the DWG file into an instance of [**Image**](https://reference.aspose.com/cad/net/aspose.cad/image).
1. Create an object of the [**CadRasterizationOptions**](https://reference.aspose.com/cad/net/aspose.cad.imageoptions/cadrasterizationoptions) class and set the [**PageHeight**](https://reference.aspose.com/cad/net/aspose.cad.imageoptions/vectorrasterizationoptions/properties/pageheight) & [**PageWidth**](https://reference.aspose.com/cad/net/aspose.cad.imageoptions/vectorrasterizationoptions/properties/pagewidth) properties.
1. Create an object of the [**PdfOptions**](https://reference.aspose.com/cad/net/aspose.cad.imageoptions/pdfoptions) class and set the [**VectorRasterizationOptions**](https://reference.aspose.com/cad/net/aspose.cad.imageoptions/vectorrasterizationoptions/properties/index) property.
1. Call [**Image.Save**](https://reference.aspose.com/cad/net/aspose.cad/image/methods/save) while passing an object of [**PdfOptions**](https://reference.aspose.com/cad/net/aspose.cad.imageoptions/pdfoptions) as the second parameter.

The code sample below shows how to export DWG Drawings to PDF.

### **Create Single PDF with Different Layout Sizes**

Aspose.CAD for .NET allows you to convert DWG file to a single PDF with different layout sizes. This approach works as follows:

1. Load a DWG file using the [**Aspose.CAD.Image.Load**](https://reference.aspose.com/cad/net/aspose.cad.image/load/methods/2) factory method.
1. Create an instance of the [**CadRasterizationOptions**](https://reference.aspose.com/cad/net/aspose.cad.imageoptions/cadrasterizationoptions) class and set the resultant page height and width.
1. Add required [**LayoutPageSizes**](https://reference.aspose.com/cad/net/aspose.cad.imageoptions/vectorrasterizationoptions/properties/layoutpagesizes) for the [**CadRasterizationOptions**](https://reference.aspose.com/cad/net/aspose.cad.imageoptions/cadrasterizationoptions) object.
1. Create an instance of [**PdfOptions**](https://reference.aspose.com/cad/net/aspose.cad.imageoptions/pdfoptions) class and set its [**VectorRasterizationOptions**](https://reference.aspose.com/cad/net/aspose.cad.imageoptions/vectorrasterizationoptions/properties/index) property.
1. Export the image to PDF using the [**Image.Save()**](https://reference.aspose.com/cad/net/aspose.cad/image/methods/save/index) method.

The code sample below shows how to create a single [PDF](https://docs.fileformat.com/pdf/) with different layouts.
