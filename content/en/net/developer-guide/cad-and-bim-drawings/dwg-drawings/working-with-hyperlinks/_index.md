## **Update Hyperlink in a DWG**

Aspose.CAD for .NET allows you to access the hyperlink in an AutoCAD drawing using the [**CadBaseEntity.Hyperlink**](https://reference.aspose.com/cad/net/aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.cadobjects/cadbaseentity/properties/hyperlink). You can access each hyperlink from this collection one by one and edit its properties.

## Sample Code

The following sample code accesses all the entities of the image and changes their [**Hyperlink**](https://reference.aspose.com/cad/net/aspose.cad.fileformats.cad.cadobjects/cadbaseentity/properties/hyperlink)Â property to the Aspose website.
