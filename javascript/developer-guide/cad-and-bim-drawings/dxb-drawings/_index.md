## **Exporting DXB Format To PNG**

Aspose.CAD for Javascript in Angular allows developers to export an DXB file to [PNG](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/png/) format.
DXB to [PNG](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/png/) conversion approach works as follows:

1. Load DXB drawing file using the **Image.load** method.
1. Call **Image.save** while passing an object of **PngOptions** as the second parameter.
