## **How to convert DWG to DWF**
Aspose.CAD provides the feature to load the AutoCAD [**DWG**](https://wiki.fileformat.com/cad/dwg/) file and export it to the [**DWF**](https://wiki.fileformat.com/cad/dwf/) format. DWG to DWF conversion approach works as follows:

1. Load DWG drawing file using the [**Image.Load**](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cad/com.aspose.cad.class-use/image) factory method.
1. Export the DWG drawing to DXF using the [**Image.Save**](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/cad/com.aspose.cad/Image#save--) method.

The code sample below shows how to convert a DWG file to a DXF format using Aspose.CAD for Java.
